## About:
Read able is a Google Chrome / Opera extension that makes it easier to focus on 
particular parts of a website, for example long text by highlighting only a part of it 
and graying out the rest. It was designed especially for people with ADHD and others, that find it 
difficult to focus on and read a long body of text without any visual highlighting the part that they
are currently reading.
